Overview

The BOSCAM rx5808 receiver module is very popular in the FPV RX builder scene.

By default it supports only 8 channels with dip switch.

By using it with SPI interface and Arduino with TVOUT it becomes a comfortable delux RX with nice autoscan and even a simple spectrum anlyser.

NOTE: RSSI CALIBRARION IS REQUIED, SEE USER MANUAL FOR DETALS

Simple to build, very low cost... cool looking.

Have fun,
